Prints out Trello Board JSON data using templated HTML. Output uses Bootstrap panel design for cards.

Changes in Fork: generate a table, and extract estimates into a separate column. We use it to copy-paste stories into a quotation for clients.

Save file to your desktop and load in your browser. Should work in any browser but printing best form Chrome.
